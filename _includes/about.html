                    <p>I began in IT as a Server Technician at University of Tennessee. As I started to understand the servers I began writing jobs and doing reporting. Within a year I was assisting in coding webpages for the University for both internal and external users as well as finishing major upgrade projects for the University's online presence. I used this ability to transition into a position in Dev Ops at Knoxville Utilities Board where I began in application development. White at KUB I worked on web applications utilizing Java and Ember, I scripted server jobs and utilized automation scripting through AWX, I created desktop reporting tools and diagnostics utilizing C# and Power Shell. When I wasn't working I was taking part in Game Jams, learning more about wider application development and growing my software development skills.</p>

                    <p>As I developed and grew in my role at KUB I took on more administration roles and began work on integrating InTune, testing new devices and shoring up our IT security. As my development grew I was given an incredible opportunity to come work and develop applications for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Division of the NNSA through Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At ORNL I became project lead on the Learning Sciences Division project to create robust AR/VR training applications utilizing custom engines as well as Unity and UnReal. These applications are used internationally for the purpose of training and educating nuclear personnel and have given me the chance to broaden my skills to include modeling and animation through Blender. I am currently working on development of these key simulations and trainings, as well as participating in Game Jams to keep my skills sharp. Look below to see my Github (what I can publicly post anyway) and chek out my most recent Game Jam game.</p>
