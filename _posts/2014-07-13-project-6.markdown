description: Knoxville Utilities Board changed providers from Verizon to AT&T beginning in February 2020. This caused issues with the current devices being used, specifically when dealing with their WWAN modems and the firmware present on them. After a few conversations with Panasonic, I got in touch with Sierra Wireless and assisted in creating a configuration of the 7355 and 7455 Sierra Wireless Modems. This configuration flashes the firmware of the modem, sets the proper ports on the computer, adds a driver for the built in environmental sensor, and selects operable bands for the card to reach. This project helped further my architecture knowledge as well as build a strong relation with both Panasonic's support team and Sierra Wireless' developers.
