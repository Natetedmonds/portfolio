description: While developing trainings in AR and VR for the Learning Sciences division of NSSD at ORNL, I was asked to assist in creating a table top AI. This AI uses NavMeshes and Raycasts to determine what objects it is near and modifies or selects the appropriate behavior given an action to perform. This AI behavior relies on a user given action and then utilizing a line of sight raycast model it then executes that action. This can be something as simple as executing a patrol behavior to more advanced flocking as seen in the objective rotation.
