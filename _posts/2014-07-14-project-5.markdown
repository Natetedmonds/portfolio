description: A legacy program by the name of JobEstimater at Knoxville Utilities Board is a crucial component of the engineer's toolkit. This program is a multiple step install that often times will take many passes to work and function correctly. Faced with a difficult and tedious install I decided to create a powershell script packaged in a runnable BAT file to handle this beast in a single click. The script utilizes LDAP plugins with RSAT to sort users into proper groups, ACL to set security policies on files and packages, and wraps everything up in a desktop shortcut for quick access by the user.
