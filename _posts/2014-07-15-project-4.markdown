description: While developing applications for Learning Sciences under NSSD at ORNL I was asked to lead a project on creating virtual trainings utilizing Augmented and/or Virtual Reality. I created these trainings utilizing Unity Enginge with XR Foundation and Vuforia. These tools allowed us to create fully packaged applications that can be sent internationally to work off of any Android or iOS device. These trainings are used to facilitate inspections, train nuclear security personnel, and as supplements to larger courses focusing on nuclear security and safety. Assests have been changed to generic versions for this demonstration.
