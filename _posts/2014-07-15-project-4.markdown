category: Powershell, Windows Deployment
description: During deployment of a new application at Knoxville Utilities Board, it became clear that the construction, linemen, and underground construction users were having issues adapting to this application due to the nature of Windows 7. I facilitated a massive project to script and upgrade each system perserving files, deleting old and unneeded applications, and creating an out of the box experience similar but more user oriented for each of these users. This project utilized the Windows deployment tool as well as powershell to create a seemless transition.
