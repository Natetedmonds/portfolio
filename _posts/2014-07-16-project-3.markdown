description: This project relates to a much larger project I worked on with the Knoxville Utilities Board Admins using Selenium Web Drivers to fetch data from webpages. This web automation script uses a simple GUI in python to collect user information for the IoT panel in AT&T Admin Console and resets their SIM card. This bot was built to accommodate an increasingly mobile workforce due to the COVID-19 crisis where SIM RAT changes and loss of connection were becoming an issue.
