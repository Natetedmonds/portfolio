description: This is a proof of concept on the ability of Sharepoint to handle older systems stored within IBM Notes. This application in particular was made to handle Travel Requests and save those to a ordered list. From there the app automates the approval process sending the request to the appropriate members in the organization via an Outlook plugin. These requests can be responded to solely within Outlook and report their responses back to the corresponding request either approving, denying, or requesting modification with or without comments.
