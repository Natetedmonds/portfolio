description: While building out projects for work I began to grow my skills outside of work by participating in Game Jams. This is the trailer to my first full release Game Jam (Brackeys 2021), Mining Hell. It is a full 3d, 6DOF, simple fps game that was made to be an homage to the classic Descent. I update the itch.io release every now and then when I want to test a new idea. Check back regularly to see more progress as I grow the project.
